# Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate our ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 


This repository contains three items required for the course project:

* README.md
* Codebook.md
* run_analysis.R and result (dtTidy.txt)


### Getting started

  1. Read through the [CodeBook](CodeBook.md) to understand the  description of the original dataset, the data acquisition process, the data transformation process, the variables, and the tidy dataset format.
  2. Read through the [run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R) script to get a general understanding of this project, the steps taken in the analysis, and the output file.
  3. Make sure the [experiment data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) is downloaded and extracted to a folder in the project directory called `UCI HAR Dataset`.
  4. Run the `run_analysis.R` script.
